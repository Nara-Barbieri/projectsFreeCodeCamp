/*COLOR SYSTEMS: FLAT COLORS
1) HTML Color Names (color keywords). 
  avaliable on https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp

2) Subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print - not used on CSS.

3) Additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices. 
  -Strategy one: RGB function
    rgb(red, green, blue);
    Each red, green, and blue value is a number from 0 to 255. 
      - 0 means that there's 0% of that color, and is black. 
      - 255 means that there's 100% of that color.
    
    WHITE: rgb (255, 255, 255)
    BLACK: rgb (0, 0, 0)
    PRIMARY RED: rgb (255, 0, 0)
    PRIMARY GREEN: rgb (0, 255, 0) 
      note: the green color of the HTML Color Names is NOT the same as the pure green rgb (0, 255, 0), instead, it is given by rgb(0, 128, 0) or #008000. 
    PRIMARY BLUE: rgb (0, 0, 255)

    Secondary colors are the colors you get when you combine primary colors. 
      YELLOW rgb (255, 255, 0) pure RED and pure GREEN
      CYAN rgb (0, 255, 255) pure GREEN and pure BLUE
      MAGENTA rgb (255, 0, 255) pure RED and pure BLUE

    Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color.
      ORANGE rgb (255, 127, 0) combining a primary RED with a nearby secondary color YELLOW
      CHARTREUSE GREEN rgb (127, 255, 0) combining a primary GREEN with a nearby secondary color YELLOW
      SPRING GREEN rgb (0, 255, 127) combining a primary GREEN with a nearby secondary color CYAN
      AZURE rgb (0, 127, 255) combining a primary BLUE with a nearby secondary color CYAN
      VIOLET rgb (127, 0, 255) combining a primary BLUE with a nearby secondary color MAGENT
      ROSE  rgb (255, 0, 127) combining a primary RED with a nearby secondary color MAGENTA

  -Strategy two: hexadecimal color code
    Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F.
      Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:
        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
  
    The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue.
    With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%.
      WHITE: #FFFFFF
      BLACK: #000000
      PRIMARY RED: #FF0000
      PRIMARY GREEN: #00FF00 
      PRIMARY BLUE: #0000FF
  
  -Strategy three: HSL color code: 
    The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: 
      a number from 0 to 360 for hue
        If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.
      a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation
        Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.
      a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.
        Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.

/*COLOR SYSTEMS: GRADIENT COLORS
	A gradient is when one color transitions into another.
	One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.
		Example: 
			.class {
  background: linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
}
			 --- gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition.
				90deg is left-right direction;
				180deg is top-bottom direction (default).
			 --- color1 and color2 are color arguments, which are the colors (keywords, hex, rgb, or hsl) that will be used in the transition itself. 
				This function needs a minimum of two color arguments to work, it can accept many color arguments.
	
		    --- Other atributes:
			The linear-gradient function automatically calculates these values, and places colors evenly along the gradient line by default.
			Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line (a length unit like px or percentages).
									Ex: linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);
