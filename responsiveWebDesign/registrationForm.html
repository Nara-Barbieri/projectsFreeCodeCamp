    In HTML5, this syntax is preferred and recommended for void elements, like <img>, <br>, <input>.
    
    <link> is traditional and more widely recognized way of writing a void element. It can be used on HTML 5, but it's usually associated with HTML4, XHTML, and older versions of HTML.
    <meta> and <!DOCTYPE html> are still usually maintained with traditional syntax-->

      <!-- The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
      Use method="get" when you want to retrieve data, perform simple searches, and the data can be part of the URL
      Use method="post" when you're submitting data that needs to be processed, you want to send larger amounts of data, or the data is sensitive and should not be exposed in the URL. -->

        Note the minlength attribute with a value of 8. It prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.
        The following and definitive version replaces minlength="8" by pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}".
          pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" attribute enforces that the user's input should consist of a minimum of 8 characters, where each character is a lowercase letter or a digit from 0 to 5.-->
